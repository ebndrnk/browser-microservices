# 🚀 Microservice Application Browser

## 🎯 Personal Project for Showcasing Tech Stack

This is a personal project created to explore and showcase various technologies in microservice architecture development. The project presents a complex system incorporating multiple components and technologies to ensure high performance, scalability, and reliability.

## 🔧 Main Technologies and Components

- Frontend: Thymeleaf 🌐
- Backend: Spring Framework 💡
- Database: PostgreSQL 🗂️
- Image Storage: Amazon S3 📸
- Caching: Redis ⚡️
- API Gateway: Spring Cloud Gateway 🚪
- Config Server: Spring Cloud Config Server 🔧
- Service Registry: Eureka 📍
- Log Collection: Kafka, Logstash, Elasticsearch 📊
- Containerization: Docker 🐳
- Orchestration: Kubernetes 🛠️

## 🏗️ Application Architecture

The application is built on a microservice architecture using the following main components:

1. **Frontend**: Developed using Thymeleaf for creating dynamic web pages.
2. **Backend**: Written in Spring Framework, providing efficient HTTP request processing.
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL is used to store data about registered users.
4. **Image Storage**: Amazon S3 is utilized for storing user photos.
5. **Caching**: Redis is used for quick access to images and session storage.
6. **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway handles routing between multiple instances of the application.
7. **Config Server**: Spring Cloud Config Server stores service configurations.
8. **Service Registry**: Eureka is used for service discovery and registration.
9. **Log Collection**: Kafka, Logstash, and Elasticsearch form a centralized log collection and analysis system.
